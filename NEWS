Version 4.2.1 (Apr 30, 2015):

* Fixed bug in computation of required registers for evaluation compiled
  expressions, which was ignoring pivoted compiled commands.

* Fixed bug in sampling engine when verifying unbounded path properties, which
  resulted in early termination of sample paths never to trigger properly.


Version 4.2 (Apr 21, 2015):

* Support multiple initial states for the hybrid engine.

* New optimized instructions for comparing variable and constant value.

* Added missing optimization of composed guards in compiled model.

* Fixed bug in expression optimization that resulted in incorrect constant
  folding in some cases.


Version 4.1 (Mar 14, 2015):

* Support for formulas and labels.

* Support for eventually (F) path operator.

* Support for Pr=?[...] properties.

* Support for unbounded until with sampling engine using weighted sampling.

* Parser support for init state expressions and system specifications.

* Fixed bug in compilation of updates for variables of type bool.


Version 3.2 (Jan 25, 2015):

* Support for DTMC model checking with sampling engine.

* Support for unbounded until properties with mixed engine.

* Support for variables of type bool.

* Support for complex constant expressions.

* New simulator that works directly with a factored event model, so that
  synchronized events do not have to be resoved up front, which can otherwise
  result in event explosion.

* Improved model optimization for simulation.

* Fixed bug in synchronization for actions with commands in more than two
  modules.


Version 3.1 (Nov 14, 2014):

* Expression and property compilation, resulting in 5-25% speedup on select
  benchmarks.

* More efficient representation of non-memoryless trigger times in a simulation
  state.

* Switched to fixed-width sequential confidence intervals for probability
  estimation.

* Changed name of single sampling plan algorithm to SSP from SEQUENTIAL.

* Switched to simple heuristic for picking nested error bounds for probabilistic
  properties.

* Improved support for PRISM expressions, including function calls and
  conditional expressions.

* Fixed bug in error bounds for conjunction, disjunction, and nested
  probabilistic properties.

* Code now uses C++11 language features.


Version 3.0.9 (Jun 2, 2012):

* More efficient representation for variable assignments in a state.  Up to
  36% speedup on polling benchmarks.


Version 3.0.8 (May 4, 2012):

* Fixed memory corruption bug in parser.

* Fixed test breakage when using GCC 4.2.


Version 3.0.7 (Apr 14, 2012):

* Fixed bug in parsing of constant overrides introduced in version 3.0.6,
  where all constant overrides would be given the value 1.  The actual speedup
  over version 3.0.5, with the bug fixed, is 10-15% on benchmarks.

* Fixed long-standing memory leak in hybrid engine.


Version 3.0.6 (Apr 10, 2012):

* Replaced Rational with TypedValue.  10-30% speedup on benchmarks.


Version 3.0.5.1 (Nov 10, 2014):

* Back port fix for memory corruption bug in parser.


Version 3.0.5 (Mar 8, 2012):

* Minor tweaks to make code compile on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard with XCode.


Version 3.0.4 (Mar 1, 2012):

* Support for fixed sample sizes and path lengths.

* Support for TCMalloc (http://code.google.com/p/gperftools).


Version 3.0.3 (Feb 9, 2012):

* Support for uninitialized constants and constant initialization from command
  line.

* Support for "true" and "false" in guard expressions.

* Support for addition and subtraction in rate expressions.

* Parser support for rewards specifications (avoids parse errors for model
  files that contain rewards specifications, but otherwise ignored).


Version 3.0.2 (Nov 18, 2011):

* Minor improvements to parser: recognition of "ctmc" model type; "const int"
  and "const double" constants.

* Limited support for constant expressions in the initializer for constants.

Version 3.0.1 (Nov 7, 2011):

* Distributed sampling no longer blocks indefinitely.

* Use correct command-line arguments in README file.

* ./ymer --help works.

* Added missing includes.

* Includes cudd-2.4.2 for easier out-of-the-box compilation.


Version 3.0 (Feb 1, 2005):

* Added support for sequential single sampling plans and probability
  estimation.

* Improved verification procedure for conjunction, disjunction,
  implication, and path formulas.

* Made statistical verification of nested probabilistic operators work
  in practice through the use of memoization and heuristics for
  selecting observation error.

* Fixed several bugs in the simulation of sample trajectories.


Version 2.1 (Mar 11, 2004):

* Simplified setup of client/server mode.  To run Ymer in server mode,
  specify a port.  To run Ymer in client mode, specify the host running
  the server and the port used by the server.  There is no longer any
  need to provide client identifiers or IP-addresses.

* Changed to TCP for client/server communication.  The server can now
  detect if a client goes down and will not expect any samples from
  clients no longer connected to the server.


Version 2.0 (Jan 25, 2004):

* Support for non-exponential distributions and distributed sampling.


Version 1.0 (Nov 7, 2003):

* Initial release.
