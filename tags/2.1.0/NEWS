Version 2.1 (Mar 11, 2004):

* Simplified setup of client/server mode.  To run Ymer in server mode,
specify a port.  To run Ymer in client mode, specify the host running
the server and the port used by the server.  There is no longer any
need to provide client identifiers or IP-addresses.

* Changed to TCP for client/server communication.  The server can now
detect if a client goes down and will not expect any samples from
clients no longer connected to the server.

Version 2.0 (Jan 25, 2004):

* Support for non-exponential distributions and distributed sampling.

Version 1.0 (Nov 7, 2003):

* Initial release.
