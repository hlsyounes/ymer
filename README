Ymer 4.2.1
==========

Ymer is a tool for verifying probabilistic properties of discrete-time Markov
chains (DTMCs), continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and generalized
semi-Markov processes (GSMPs).  Properties are expressed using the Continuous
Stochastic Logic (CSL).

To handle the full generality of GSMPs, Ymer implements statistical techniques,
based on discrete event simulation and sequential acceptance sampling, for CSL
model checking.  Ymer includes support for distributed acceptance sampling,
i.e. the use of multiple machines to generate samples, which can result in
significant speedup as each sample can be generated independently.

Ymer can also use numerical techniques based on uniformization by approximating
a GSMP with a CTMC using phase-type distributions.  Ymer includes the hybrid
engine from the PRISM tool for CTMC model checking.  Numerical and statistical
techniques can be used in combination to solve nested CSL queries.


Installation
============

Installation instructions are available in INSTALL.


Running Ymer
============

Ymer is controlled by a command line interface.  Run `./ymer --help' for details
on available command line options.


Distributed Sampling
====================

To start Ymer in server mode, provide a port with the command line options.  The
server will accept connections from clients, which will provide the server with
samples.  To connect a client to a server, pass a host name and a port to Ymer.
The following commands give you an example of how to use distributed sampling
with Ymer:

  cpu1> ymer -P 5000 examples/tandem63.sm examples/tandem500.csl

  cpu2> ymer -H cpu1 -P 5000 examples/tandem63.sm examples/tandem500.csl

  cpu3> ymer -H cpu1 -P 5000 examples/tandem63.sm examples/tandem500.csl

This starts a server on a machine called `cpu1' and a client on each of the
machines called `cpu2' and `cpu3'.  Once enough samples have been generated, the
server terminates, which in turn causes the clients to terminate as well.

Using ssh, for example, it is possible to write a script that will start a
server locally and a set of clients on remote machines.  An example of such a
script is `scripts/ymer-dist2', which runs a server on the local machine and two
sample generating clients on two machines named `sweden' and `gs222'.

Note that the model and property files must be available on all machines running
Ymer.  The behavior of Ymer is unspecified if a client uses a different model or
property than the server it connects to.
