Version 4.0 (Jan 18, 2011):
===========================

* Adds support for unbounded until.

* Removes support for symbolic model checking.

* Includes a copy of cudd-2.4.2 for easier out-of-the-box compilation.


Version 3.0 (Feb 1, 2005):
==========================

* Added support for sequential single sampling plans and probability
  estimation.

* Improved verification procedure for conjunction, disjunction, implication,
  and path formulae.

* Made statistical verification of nested probabilistic operators work in
  practice through the use of memoization and heuristics for selecting
  observation error.

* Fixed several bugs in the simulation of sample trajectories.


Version 2.1 (Mar 11, 2004):
===========================

* Simplified setup of client/server mode.  To run Ymer in server mode, specify
  a port.  To run Ymer in client mode, specify the host running the server and
  the port used by the server.  There is no longer any need to provide client
  identifiers or IP-addresses.

* Changed to TCP for client/server communication.  The server can now detect
  if a client goes down and will not expect any samples from clients no longer
  connected to the server.


Version 2.0 (Jan 25, 2004):
===========================

* Support for non-exponential distributions and distributed sampling.


Version 1.0 (Nov 7, 2003):
==========================

* Initial release.
