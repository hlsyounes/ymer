Version 3.0.5 (Mar 8, 2012):

* Minor tweaks to make code compile on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard with XCode.


Version 3.0.4 (Mar 1, 2012):

* Support for fixed sample sizes and path lengths.

* Support for TCMalloc (http://code.google.com/p/gperftools).


Version 3.0.3 (Feb 9, 2012):

* Support for uninitialized constants and constant initialization from command
  line.

* Support for "true" and "false" in guard expressions.

* Support for addition and subtraction in rate expressions.

* Parser support for rewards specifications (avoids parse errors for model
  files that contain rewards specifications, but otherwise ignored).


Version 3.0.2 (Nov 18, 2011):

* Minor improvements to parser: recognition of "ctmc" model type; "const int"
  and "const double" constants.

* Limited support for constant expressions in the initializer for constants.

Version 3.0.1 (Nov 7, 2011):

* Distributed sampling no longer blocks indefinitely.

* Use correct command-line arguments in README file.

* ./ymer --help works.

* Added missing includes.

* Includes cudd-2.4.2 for easier out-of-the-box compilation.


Version 3.0 (Feb 1, 2005):

* Added support for sequential single sampling plans and probability
  estimation.

* Improved verification procedure for conjunction, disjunction,
  implication, and path formulas.

* Made statistical verification of nested probabilistic operators work
  in practice through the use of memoization and heuristics for
  selecting observation error.

* Fixed several bugs in the simulation of sample trajectories.


Version 2.1 (Mar 11, 2004):

* Simplified setup of client/server mode.  To run Ymer in server mode,
  specify a port.  To run Ymer in client mode, specify the host running
  the server and the port used by the server.  There is no longer any
  need to provide client identifiers or IP-addresses.

* Changed to TCP for client/server communication.  The server can now
  detect if a client goes down and will not expect any samples from
  clients no longer connected to the server.


Version 2.0 (Jan 25, 2004):

* Support for non-exponential distributions and distributed sampling.


Version 1.0 (Nov 7, 2003):

* Initial release.
